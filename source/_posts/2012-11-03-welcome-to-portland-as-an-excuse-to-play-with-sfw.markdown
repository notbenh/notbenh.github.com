So like many in Portland I have been following [Ward's](https://github.com/WardCunningham "Ward's github account") adventure in to re-imagining what a wiki could be: [Smallest Federated Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki "Smallest Federated Wiki on github"). As with any project it has warts, points that could be clarified, though all in all it's a need sandbox project. So much so that I started building out a ["so you are new to portland"](http://wiki.notbenh.info/view/welcome-visitors/view/new-to-portland "so you are new to portland") page as a way to see what is possible. 

The good news is that it has also added a few tdone's to the list: 

   * fix the docs, currently there is no consistent documentation on to deeply this. There is a non-standard structure to the project. I am guessing that this is due to the experimental nature of things, though because of this you really do need to know what you are doing. I think that smoothing some wrinkles out and documenting this process further could help get more hands on the projects (if that is even a desirable goal?)
   * In my opinion the wiki-ish syntax is a little weird. Currently, from all the examples and things that I got working you are using a subset of HTML as HTML except for links? All in all a fine design decision but again this lacks documentation. So I'll see what I can get done in that department. 
   * How to really use this thing? From what little I had played with before hand, it is a great note taking tool... but what this acts like in the "real" world has yet to be seen by me. I have no ideas how to make this all go so I will need to monitor things to see how they change and to see if there is any back-channel notification when some one clones your content? We'll just have to see on this one. 

So there we have it, I'm playing with new toys... wanna play along?
